Description:
Abstract: Data source is the Office of Tax and Revenue’s Computer-Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) system. The CAMA system is used by the Assessment Division (AD) within the Real Property Tax Administration to value real estate for ad valorem real property tax purposes.The intent of this data is to provide a sale history for active properties listed among the District of Columbia’s real property tax assessment roll. This data is updated daily. The AD constantly maintains sale data, adding new data and updating existing data. Daily updates represent a “snapshot” at the time the data was extracted from the CAMA system, and data is always subject to change.
Purpose: Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) database. The dataset contains attribution on housing characteristics for residential properties, and was created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating D.C. government agencies. Properties on the assessment roll are primarily identified by Square, Suffix, Lot (SSL). Data will be most useful when joined by SSL to other real property data.
Supplemental Information: Most lots have one building in the CAMA file, assigned BLDG_NUM of one in the table. For parcels where multiple buildings exist, the primary building (such as the main residence) is assigned BLDG_NUM = 1. The other buildings or structures have BLDG_NUM values in random sequential order. After the primary structure, there is no way to associate BLDG_NUM > 2 records with any particular structure on the lot.

Process Description:
OTR provides a dump of the Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) Data quarterly in MS Access database format. The database consists of the following tables: Comm_Extract (Commercial) Condo_Extract (Condos) Res_Extract (Residential) Each CAMA table contains an SSL field. However, there are multiple records per SSL creating a many-to-one relate with the ownerpoint dataset. Thus, the tabular gets processed first to generate unique records per SSL. Staff generated the the unique record tables through four steps: 1 - Copy the table structure of the existing CAMA tables. 2 - Build three select queries to access the unique records. 3 - Change the select queries to append queries and define them to append the filtered records to the new templates. 4 - Run the append queries to create the unique record tables. Next, staff joined each unique record table to the ownerpoint to spatially enable each CAMA data type: commercial, condo, and residential. As part of this process, staff created a slimmed down version of the ownerpoint table since most of the fields are not used. Staff generated the feature classes by: 1 - Establishing GIS data architecture for spatial data and create the base real property layers for this process. 2 - Generating the spatial layers for the CAMA data by joining them to the slimmed down version of the owner point layer. 3 - Stripping Date Fields from ownerpoints. 4 - Selecting all of the records with a CAMA SSL value and creating a layer from the selected features. 5 - Exporting the selection layer to a new feature class. 6 - Incorporating and updating metadata. These steps are run on all three CAMA tables.
